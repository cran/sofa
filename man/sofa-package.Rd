\section{About sofa}{

\pkg{sofa} provides an interface to the NoSQL database CouchDB
(\url{http://couchdb.apache.org}). Methods are provided for managing
databases within CouchDB, including creating/deleting/updating/transferring,
and managing documents within databases. One can connect with a local
CouchDB instance, or a remote CouchDB databases such as Cloudant
(\url{https://cloudant.com}). Documents can be inserted directly from
vectors, lists, data.frames, and JSON.
}

\section{Client connections}{

All functions take as their first parameter a client connection object,
or a \strong{cushion}. Create the object with \code{\link{Cushion}}. You
can have multiple connection objects in an R session.
}

\section{CouchDB versions}{

\pkg{sofa} was built assuming CouchDB version 2 or greater. Some
functionality of this package will work with versions < 2, while
some may not (mango queries, see \code{\link{db_query}}). I don't
plan to support older CouchDB versions per se.
